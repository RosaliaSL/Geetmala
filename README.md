# Geetmala üìª - An online version of Saregama Carvaan

## Information related to the hackathon
Theme: Diversity & Inclusion and Open Innovation

This website falls under both the themes. 

**Diversity & Inclusion**: This website aims to include the elderly who have trouble navigating on conventional websites like youtube, and get overwhelmed
by the massive amount of information that is availiable on the internet. With our website, they can listen to their favourite songs from a single place without needing to search for them. Most websites aren't made keeping the elderly in mind. We also don't have many music websites which cater to people who
are interested in listening to old Bollywood music specifically. Most modern websites have a lot of controls which can be confusing to use.


## Description
Your one-stop jukebox to listen to your favourite bollywood hits from the past!
An app that lets you browse through different themes to listen to a variety of songs,
all in one convenient place!
No need to spend thousands of rupees on a physical Carvaan device,
because Geetmala has you covered!

Great for the eldery who have trouble navigating Youtube,
all songs can be accessed with the click of a single button!
